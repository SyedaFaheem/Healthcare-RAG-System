# Healthcare-RAG-System
- A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for answering patient queries using a curated healthcare knowledge base.

## Features
- Generates medically-informed responses grounded in document context.
- Retrieves relevant documents using document embeddings and cosine similarity.
- Integrates a GPT-style generative model for natural language answers.
- Evaluates responses for content relevance, medical term usage, and length.
  
## Key Insights
- RAG improves factual accuracy by grounding answers in retrieved documents.
- Challenges: retrieval quality, token limits, and scalability for large knowledge bases.
- Enhancements: vector databases, domain-specific fine-tuning, human-in-the-loop validation.
- Ethical considerations: accuracy, privacy, bias mitigation, transparency, and responsible use.
